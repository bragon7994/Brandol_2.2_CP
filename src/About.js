          founded in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah. The company 
          started as a restaurant review platform and has since expanded to 
          become one of the largest food delivery services in India and around
          the world. Today, Zomato operates in over 24 countries and 
          provides access to over 1.4 million restaurants worldwide. The app 
          offers a range of features, including menus, photos, ratings, and 
          reviews, to help users find and order food from their favorite 
          restaurants.<br></br> <br></br>In addition to food delivery, Zomato has also
           expanded its services to include restaurant reservations, event 
           management, and table management solutions for restaurants. The 
           company has also launched several initiatives to support the 
           restaurant industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, including zero 
           commission on food delivery and financial assistance to struggling 
           restaurants. <br></br> <br></br>At Zomato, we are committed to making food accessible 
           and enjoyable for everyone. We believe that food is not just about 
           sustenance, but also about the joy of sharing a meal with loved ones
           and exploring different cuisines. Our mission is to create a world
           where everyone has access to delicious food and memorable dining experiences.
